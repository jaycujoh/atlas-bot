## Updates

### üöÄ Latest Changes
- **Removed `RESOURCES` Section**:
  - The `RESOURCES` section has been removed from the analysis to free up character space for more detailed insights in the existing sections (`STRATEGIC SUCCESS`, `TACTICAL WEAKNESS`, etc.).
  - This change ensures the bot focuses entirely on providing actionable advice and tactical analysis without relying on external links.

- **Enhanced Data Analysis**:
  - Improved the accuracy of replay data extraction by:
    - Tracking **unit production** more precisely using `UnitBornEvent` and `UnitInitEvent`.
    - Adding a `units_produced` dictionary to count the number of each unit type created during the game.
  - Updated the AI prompt to include **specific replay data** (e.g., units produced, build order) to ensure the analysis is based on accurate information.
  - Added validation checks to prevent the AI from making incorrect assumptions (e.g., claiming a "ling-bane" strategy was used when no Banelings were produced).

### ‚è™ Previous Updates
- **Added Build Order Table**:
  - The bot now posts a formatted build order table to Discord, showing the time, supply, and units/buildings created for each player.
  - Grouped identical units created at the same time for better readability.

- **Improved Error Handling**:
  - Added error handling for cases where the replay contains only one player or fails to load.
  - Logged warnings for events that cannot be processed (e.g., unsupported unit types).

- **Enhanced AI Analysis**:
  - Updated the AI prompt to provide more detailed and actionable advice.
  - Increased the `max_tokens` limit to allow for longer and more comprehensive analysis.

### üîÆ Future Plans
- **Re-Adding the `RESOURCES` Section**:
  - Integrate a **web-browsing feature** into the AI to dynamically fetch relevant resources (e.g., articles, videos, and guides) based on the replay analysis.
  - Ensure the resources are **accurate and up-to-date** by linking to trusted sources like YouTube, TeamLiquid, and Reddit.
  - Provide tailored recommendations for specific challenges, such as countering a particular composition or improving build order execution.

- **Adding Commands**:
  - Introduce **user commands** to allow for more interactive and customizable analysis.
  - Examples:
    - `!analyze <replay_file>`: Analyze a specific replay file.
    - `!buildorder <player_name>`: Display the build order for a specific player.
    - `!resources <topic>`: Fetch resources for a specific topic (e.g., countering a particular strategy).

- **Creating an .exe File**:
  - Develop a standalone **.exe application** for easier installation and use, especially for users who are not familiar with Python or command-line tools.
  - This will make ATLAS more accessible to a wider audience.

- **Add More Detailed Metrics**:
  - Include additional metrics such as resource collection rates, APM (actions per minute), and unit losses.
- **Support for More Replay Types**:
  - Extend support for team games (2v2, 3v3, etc.) and custom game modes.
- **User Customization**:
  - Allow users to customize the analysis format (e.g., include/exclude specific sections, adjust the level of detail).
