# ATLAS - StarCraft II Replay Analysis Bot

## ü§ñ About ATLAS

ATLAS is an **open-source**, AI-powered Discord bot designed to help StarCraft II players analyze their replays and improve their gameplay. As a new developer and StarCraft II player, I wanted to create something that could help others learn and grow in the game.

### **Current Approach**
- **Open-Source**: The bot is completely open-source, meaning anyone can download, modify, and host it themselves using their own OpenAI API key.
- **Future Plans**: If ATLAS gains enough traction, I plan to introduce a **hosted version** of the bot with additional features and support for those who prefer a ready-to-use solution.

## üöÄ Hosted Version (No AI)

For users who prefer a ready-to-use solution without AI functionality, a **hosted version** of ATLAS is available. This version focuses on replay parsing and build order extraction.

### **Features**:
- **Replay Upload**: Upload a replay file, and the bot will automatically process it.
- **Build Order Table**: The bot will post a formatted build order table showing time, supply, and units/buildings created.
- **No AI Analysis**: This version does not include AI-generated insights or recommendations.

### **How to Use**:
1. Invite the bot to your server using [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1350799094225961053).
2. Upload a replay file to the designated channel.
3. The bot will post the build order table.
